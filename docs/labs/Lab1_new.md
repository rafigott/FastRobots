# Lab 1: The Artemis board and Bluetooth

## Part 1) Objective
The purpose of this part of the lab is for you to setup and become familiar with the Arduino IDE and the Artemis board. After this lab, you should be comfortable programming your board, using the board LED, reading/writing serial messages over USB, and using the onboard temperature sensor and Pulse Density Microphone.

## Parts Required

(These will be handed out during lab 1 - note if you decide to drop the class please give these back to a TA.)

* 1 x SparkFun RedBoard Artemis Nano
* 1 x USB C-to-C or A-to-C cable

## Prelab
Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) on your computer. Please use the latest versions of ArduinoIDE and Sparkfun Appollo3 support software. Update them if necessary. If you have any issues, please contact the TA team.
While we only guarantee TA support on the lab computers this semester, you can likely do all Arduino-related tasks on your own computer which will save everyone time! 
   
Check out the Artemis description, features, and helpful forums here:
1. [SparkFun RedBoard Artemis Nano](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15443). *Note that this is a 3V board, NOT 5V, but 3V. Please. Remember. 3V. Inputs. Only.*
2. [Setup instructions](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/artemis-development-with-arduino?_ga=2.30055167.1151850962.1594648676-1889762036.1574524297&_gac=1.19903818.1593457111.Cj0KCQjwoub3BRC6ARIsABGhnyahkG7hU2v-0bSiAeprvZ7c9v0XEKYdVHIIi_-J-m5YLdDBMc2P_goaAtA4EALw_wcB)

Finally, please skim the lab instructions in order to be prepared for what to do in your section!

## Instructions

*For all of the following tasks, think about how you will document that your code works. We cannot grade "I did this..". Instead, you can choose to upload photos, screenshots of the serial monitor, screen-recordings, videos of the board, and/or grab the data from the serial monitor and plot them in a graph. As always, feel free to check [last years solutions](https://cei-lab.github.io/ECE4960-2022/StudentPages.html) for examples.* 

1. Hook the Artemis board up to your computer, and follow the instructions from bulletpoint 2 above ("Introduction" and "Arduino Installation"). Typical issues encountered include...    
    1. Bad connections, because the USB connector needs to be pressed fully into the Artemis board.
    2. If you are running Windows and the first compilation takes a long time, try adding "C:\Program Files\Arduino" (or the particular project folder) to the antivirus exclusions. 
2. From the setup instructions linked above, follow the instructions in "Example: Blink it Up". (Note: you may need to slow the baud rate down for it to work.)
3. In File->Examples->Artemis Examples, run Example2_Serial. (Note: to view the output and provide input open the serial monitor in the upper right hand corner of the script window.)
4. In File->Examples->Artemis Examples, run Example4_analogRead to test your temperature sensor. Try blowing on or touching the chip to change its temperature. It may take a while to transfer your heat. 
5. In File->Examples->PDM, run Example1_MicrophoneOutput to test your microphone. E.g. try whistling or speaking to change the highest frequency.

# Additional tasks for 5000-level students

6. Program the board to turn on the LED when you play a musical "A" note over the speaker, and off otherwise. Use your phone, computer, or similar to generate the sound. If you're having fun you could even combine the microphone and the Serial output to generate an electronic tuner.




## Part 2) Objective
The purpose of part two of this lab is to establish communication between your computer and the Artemis board through the Bluetooth stack. 
We will be using Python inside a Jupyter notebook on the computer end and the Arduino programming language on the Artemis side.
We will also establish a framework for sending data via Bluetooth that will be useful in future labs.

## Prelab
Please read up on this [fantastic summary](https://www.Arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoBLE) of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

### Computer Setup

#### Install Python
You will need to install Python 3 and pip. If you already have them installed, please make sure you have the latest releases (Python >= 3.9 and pip >= 21.0). 

<details>
  <summary><strong>How to check for versions?</strong></summary>
    In a Command Line Interface (CLI), run the below commands to check for Python and pip versions:

[[Relevant xkcd]](https://xkcd.com/1654/)

#### Virtual Environment
A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, and (by default) any libraries installed in a “system” Python, i.e., one which is installed as part of your operating system.

##### Install venv
Run the following commands in a Command Line Interface (CLI):
1. Install venv
    ```python
    python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
    ```
2. Navigate to your project directory (folder).
    > Place all your Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks within this directory.
3. Create a new virtual environment named "FastRobots_ble"
    ```python
    python3 -m venv FastRobots_ble
    ```
    > venv will create a virtual Python installation in the newly created **FastRobots_ble** directory.


##### Using a virtual environment
For any lab using Python scripts (or Jupyter notebooks), you will first need to activate your virtual environment.

1. Activate the virtual environment
    > This will only work from the project folder (the one containing the **FastRobots_ble** folder).

    <div class="tab">
    <button class="tablinks 2 active" onclick="openTab(event, 'L2', '2')">Linux/FreeBSD</button>
    <button class="tablinks 2" onclick="openTab(event, 'W2', '2')">Windows</button>
    <button class="tablinks 2" onclick="openTab(event, 'M2', '2')">macOS</button>
    </div>

    <div id="L2" class="tabcontent 2" style="display: block">
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>source FastRobots_ble/bin/activate</code></pre></div></div>
    </div>

    <div id="W2" class="tabcontent 2">
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.\FastRobots_ble\Scripts\activate</code></pre></div></div>
    </div>

    <div id="M2" class="tabcontent 2">
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>source FastRobots_ble/bin/activate</code></pre></div></div>
    </div>

2. Your CLI prompt should now have the prefix **(FastRobots_ble)**.
3. To deactivate the virtual environment, run the following command:
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
    > Your CLI prompt should no longer display the prefix.

##### Install Python Packages
1. Activate your virtual environment:
    > Your CLI prompt should now have the prefix **(FastRobots_ble)**.
2. Install packages:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pyyaml colorama nest_asyncio bleak jupyterlab
    ```
**NOTE**: In Windows, you may see an error while installing some of these packages. Follow the download link in the error message to download and install (the unnecessarily huge) C++ build tools.

### Lab 2 Codebase

1. Download and unzip the [codebase](./ble_robot-1.1.zip) into your project directory.
2. Copy the ```ble_python``` directory into your project directory.

```
ble_robot-1.1
├── ble_arduino
|   ├── ble_arduino.ino - Arduino code that will be compiled and run on the Artemis board
|   ├── BLECStringCharacteristic.h - class definition used to send and receive data
|   ├── EString.h - class definition for Extended String used to easily manipulate character arrays
|   └── RobotCommand.h - class definition used to extract values of different data types from the robot command string sent to the Artemis board
└── ble_python

    |   ├── __init__.py
    └── utils.py
```

### Start Jupyter Server
We will be using Jupyter notebooks to write Python code. Before you can open a Jupyter notebook, you need to start the Jupyter server. **If the Jupyter server is stopped, you will not be able to run/open/modify any Jupyter notebooks.**

1. In a CLI, navigate to your project directory and activate your virtual environment.
2. Start the Jupyter server
    > The Jupyter server can only access notebooks from the directory it was started in.

    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    > macOS users may have to use `Jupyter lab` (capital J).
3. A browser tab should open up with JupyterLab.
   > If no window opens up, click on the URL displayed in the CLI.

You will be writing most of your Python code using this browser window on Jupyter notebooks. For students proficient in Python, you may choose to write some of your modules in Python script files and import them into your Jupyter notebook.

If you are new to JupyterLab, please go through the [Introduction to JupyterLab](https://cei-lab.github.io/FastRobots-2023/tutorials/jupyter_notebooks.html) tutorial (available under the [Tutorials](https://cei-lab.github.io/FastRobots-2023/tutorials/) page).

### Read Through Codebase
Please read through the codebase (in particular, the ```demo.ipynb``` Jupyter notebook) to understand the different functions that you will be using in this lab.

### Artemis Board Setup

#### Install ArduinoBLE
Install **ArduinoBLE** from the library manager (Tools -> Manage Libraries...) in the Arduino IDE.

#### Burn Artemis Codebase
1. Load and burn the sketch **ble_arduino.ino** into the Artemis board from the directory **ble_arduino** in the codebase.
    > Make sure you change the serial baud rate to 115200 bps.
2. The Artemis board should now print its MAC address.

## Code Summary 

The Python and Artemis packages provide you with the base code necessary to establish a communication channel between your computer and the Artemis board through BLE. 

### Bluetooth Library Limitations

Though a characteristic value can be up to 512 bytes long (according to the Bluetooth Core Specification), the ArduinoBLE library limits the maximum size to 255 bytes. We are using a more conservative size limitation of 150 bytes. The provided Python codebase throws an error if you attempt to send data that is larger than the member variable ArtemisBLEController.max_write_length (150 bytes). On the Arduino side, the macro MAX_MSG_SIZE (defined in EString.h) is used to set the character array sizes used in various classes.

### ble_arduino – Processing Commands on the Artemis Board

This is a summary of the code running on your Artemis, found in the ```ble_arduino.ino``` file.

1. **BLE UUIDS**
* These are the Universally Unique Identifiers. This helps differentiate the different kinds of data that you’d want to send between the Artemis and your computer. 
* In order to generate new UUIDs to use, run these lines in your Jupyter Notebook and copy them to the appropriate places.
 ```python
   from uuid import uuid4
   uuid4()
 ```

2. **BLEService**
* Used to set advertised local name and service, add BLE characteristics, and add BLE service
* See setup in ```ble_arduino.ino``` to see how to use BLEService for our purposes, or [this page](https://docs.arduino.cc/retired/archived-libraries/CurieBLE#bleservice-class) for more examples
* If you add more UUIDs/characters (different kinds of data to transmit/receive), don’t forget to add the characteristic to the BLEService

3. **BLExCharacteristic**
* These are constructors for handling different types of data provided by ArduinoBLE. Please read [this page](https://docs.arduino.cc/retired/archived-libraries/CurieBLE#blecharacteristic-class) for more details on types, syntax, parameters and examples.
* These three types are what we recommend, and should be sufficient for this class (but feel free to use other types if you feel the need):
  * BLEFloatCharacteristic
  * BLEIntCharacteristic
  * BLECStringCharacteristic – this is not provided by ArduinoBLE but defined in BLECStringCharacteristic.h
* For receiving data on the Artemis, only use BLECStringCharacteristic as it defines a writable string GATT characteristic for communicating robot commands
* Relevant functions:
  * Constructor – parameters for constructors of relevant characteristics are found at the top of ```ble_arduino.ino```,  or [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/retired/archived-libraries/CurieBLE#bleservice-class) for all the characteristics
  * For transmitting characteristics:
    * ```writeValue( value );``` – value to transmit to your computer; ensure that the data type matches the characteristic type you use
  * For receiving characteristics:
    * ```written();``` – returns 1 if value has been written to this UUID by another BLE device
    * ```value();``` and ```valueWritten();``` – returns a uint8 array containing the BLE characteristic value, and the length of the uint8 array; used in ```set_cmd_string()``` function in RobotCommand.h

4. **RobotCommand**
* This is a class defined in RobotCommand.h
* RobotCommand is used when handling a robot command that the Artemis receives, of the string format “\<cmd_type\>:\<value1\>\|\<value2\>\|\<value3\>\|...”
  * \<cmd_type\> is an integer
  * \<value\> can be a float (or double), integer, or string literal
* Used in the function handle_command() in ```ble_arduino.ino```.
* Relevant functions:
  * Constructor – instantiates object; takes a string (character array) to specify the delimiters used to tokenize the robot command string e.g. ```RobotCommand robot_cmd(":|");``` where “:\|” is the delimiter
  * ```set_cmd_string( value, valueWritten );``` – set the command string from the characteristic value received for the RobotCommand object instantiated
  * ```get_command_type( cmd_type );``` – returns 1 if successful; sets ```cmd_type``` as the integer value sent by the other device
  * ```get_next_value( val );``` – returns 1 if successful; extracts the next value from the command string and assigns it to ```val```; ensure that the type of val is what is expected (by ensuring you handle ```cmd_type``` properly in case statements in ```handle_command()```)

5. **EString (Enhanced String)**
* Used to easily manipulate character arrays, defined in EString.h
* The header provides getter and setter functions to convert between a character array and an EString object
* We recommend using this when transmitting strings from the Artemis to your computer
* See case PING in ```handle_command()``` in ```ble_arduino.ino``` for an example on how to use EString
* Relevant functions:
  * ```clear();``` – empties the contents of the character array
  * ```append();``` – append a float, double, int, character array, or string literal to the EString
  * ```c_str();``` – returns the character array

6. **enum CommandTypes**
* This enumerates the variables in CommandTypes e.g. “PING” has the value 0, “SEND_TWO_INTS” has the value 1
* This is used in the case statements in ```handle_command()```

7. **handle_commmand()**
* This is the function that handles commands received by your computer by using a switch statement to determine what action to take depending on the command received ([what is a switch statement?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/switch-statement-cc/))

## Instructions 

### Configurations

1. Update your Artemis MAC Address
* In connections.yaml: replace the artemis_address value with the MAC address printed by your Artemis in the prelab on this line:
```python
artemis_address: 'C0:C2:8A:89:98:08'
```
> A valid MAC address is a 12 digit hexadecimal number, often represented as 6 pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by colons. If the Artemis board displays a MAC address that is lesser than 12 digits, left pad the appropriate pairs with 0s. For example, if the displayed MAC address is `C0:C2:8A:89:98:8`, update the configuration file(**connection.yaml**) with
```yaml
artemis_address: 'C0:C2:8A:89:98:08'
```
2. Change BLEService UUID: Without changing this, you might connect to your classmates' Artemis boards instead of your own.
* Generate a new UUID
 ```
   from uuid import uuid4
   uuid4()
 ```
* In ble_arduino.ino: replace the BLEService UUID with this generated UUID on this line:
``` arduino
#define BLE_UUID_TEST_SERVICE "9A48ECBA-2E92-082F-C079-9E75AAE428B1" 
```
* In connections.yaml: replace ble_service with this generated UUID on this line:
``` python
ble_service: '9a48ecba-2e92-082f-c079-9e75aae428b1' 
```
* (Extra step for Windows/Linux) In base_ble.py: change line 53 from
```python
if IS_ATLEAST_MAC_OS_12:
```
to
```python
if True:
```
3. The UUIDs used in the Arduino sketch should match those used by Python in the configuration file (**connection.yaml**).
4. The command types defined in *enum CommandTypes* in the Arduino sketch should match those defined in cmd_types.py.

* Before carrying out the tasks, ensure that you open the **demo.ipynb** notebook in the directory **ble_python** in JupyterLab. Follow and test the instructions in the notebook to test and use BLE.
> Run through all the cells before you begin to work on the lab tasks.

### Tasks

In order to test your robot's sensors more effectively, it is critical to have a working wireless debugging system. The following tasks will ensure that you can receive timestamped messages from the Artemis board.

1. Send an *ECHO* command with a string value from the computer to the Artemis board, and receive an augmented string on the computer.
    > For example, the computer sends the string value "HiHello" to the Artemis board using the ECHO command, and the computer receives the augmented string "Robot says -> HiHello :)" from a read GATT characteristic.

2. Add a command GET_TIME_MILLIS which makes the robot reply write a string such as "T:123456" to the string characteristic.

3. Setup a notification handler in Python to receive the string value (the **BLEStringCharactersitic** in Arduino) from the Artemis board. In the callback function, extract the time from the string.

4. Write a loop that gets the current time in milliseconds and sends it to your laptop to be received and processed by the notification handler. Collect these values for a few seconds and use the time stamps to determine how fast messages can be sent. What is the effective data transfer rate of this method?

5. Now create an array that can store time stamps. This array should be defined globally so that other functions can access it if need be. In the loop, rather than send each time stamp, place each time stamp into the array. (Note: you'll need some extra logic to determine when your array is full so you don't "over fill" the array.) Then add a command SEND_TIME_DATA which loops the array and sends each data point as a string to your laptop to be processed. (You can store these values in a list in python to determine if all the data was sent over.)

6. Add a second array that is the same size as the time stamp array. Use this array to store temperature readings. Each element in both arrays should correspond, e.e., the first time stamp was recorded at the same time as the first temperature reading. Then add a command GET_TEMP_READINGS that loops through both arrays concurrently and sends each temperature reading with a time stamp. The notification handler should parse these strings and add populate the data into two lists.

7. Discuss the differences between these two methods, the advantages and disadvantages of both and the potential scenarios that you might choose one method over the other. How "quickly" can the second method record data? The Artemis board has 384 kB of RAM. Approximately how much data can you store to send without running out of memory?



<!--
7. Optional: You can try sending plain byte arrays over a
suitably-typed Bluetooth characteristic. You could also
explore sending character arrays that represent bytes, such
as base64-encoded bytes.

6. In your report, briefly explain the difference between the two approaches:
   1. Receive a float value in Python using **receive_float()** on a characteristic that is defined as **BLEFloatCharactersitic** in the Arduino side
   2. Receive a float value in Python using **receive_string()** (and subsequently converting it to a float type in Python) on a characteristic that is defined as a **BLECStringCharactersitic** in the Arduino side
   -->

## Additional tasks for 5000-level students
  
Perform an analysis on the communication performance.
> TIP: Use the notification handler for this. If you find a better way, include your approach in the write-up.

1. **Effective Data Rate And Overhead**: Send a message from the computer and receive a reply from the Artemis board. Note the respective times for each event, calculate the data rate
for 5-byte replies and 120-byte replies. Do many short
packets introduce a lot of overhead? Do larger replies help 
to reduce overhead? You may also test additional reply sizes.
Please include at least one plot to support your write-up.

2. **Reliability**: What happens when you send data at a higher rate from the robot to the computer? Does the computer read all the data published (without missing anything) from the Artemis board? Include your answer in the write-up.

## Write-up

Word Limit: < 1000 words

We understand that some of the sections in your webpage will overlap with the instructions in the lab handout. That is okay as long as there is no blatant copying and pasting. Paraphrase instructions in a way that shows you understand and have executed them.

### Webpage sections

This is not a strict requirement, but may be helpful in understanding what should be included in your webpage. It also helps with the flow of your report to show your understanding to the lab graders.

1. Prelab:
* Setup: Briefly describe the steps taken to set up your computer for Lab 2, showing any results (i.e. MAC address printing)
* Codebase: Add a brief explanation of your understanding of the codebase and how Bluetooth works between your computer and the Artemis

2. Lab Tasks:
* Configurations: Show what the relevant configurations, anything that was specifically needed to address the tasks.
* Include a brief explanation on what you did and results for each task.
* Address all questions posed in the lab.
* Include screenshots, screen recordings, pictures, or videos of relevant results (i.e. messages received in Jupyter Notebook, serial terminal print of messages received by Artemis).

3. Discussion:
* **Briefly** describe what you've learned, challenges that you faced, and/or any unique solutions used to fix problems. It is important to keep these writeups succinct. You will not get extra points for writing more words if the content doesn't contribute to communicating your understanding of the lab material. 

Please also include code __snippets__ (consider using [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com)) in appropriate sections if you included any written code. **Do not copy and paste all your code.** Include only relevant functions used for each task. **Points will be deducted for pasting all of your code in the lab report.** Also consider adding pseudocode snippets if large amounts of code are needed to explain your lab.
